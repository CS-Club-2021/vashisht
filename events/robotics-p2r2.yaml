description: "Picking things from one point and placing them somewhere else seems to come very naturally to human beings. For example, we pick our answers from Google and place them into our assignments ;P. Since humans are very good at this skill, we bring forth the  P2R2 (aka Pick & Place with 2R Robot) competition where you transfer your expertise into an assembled bunch of sticks and wires. So pick up your tools and place them right!"
